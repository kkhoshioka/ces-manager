# Deployment Workflow

This project uses Git-based deployment (likely Vercel or similar connected to the repository).

To deploy changes:
1. Ensure all changes are staged and committed.
2. Push the changes to the `main` branch.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

// turbo-all
